# Team 4 Project 3
<h2>Information about your visualizations and what they show. Include information about interactions as appropriate.</h2>

Our website has four sections. The first section, made by Yonghao, illustrated the citizen owning rate of each technology in each country by using a set of bar charts. The second section, made by Hathaway, showed the distribution of importance of concerns for people shopping for new connected products by using a beautiful colormap. The third section, made by Tianlun and Yi, also plotted a set of bar charts illustrated the distribution of what tech terms are people confortable explaining to a friend in each and every country. The fourth section, made by Gongyuan, created a line chart visualization of the rate of Price over Feature in China from 8/22/2017 till 9/11/2017, specifically. 

<h2>Your design process (e.g., how did you go about designing, building, and refining your system? Why did you choose these representations?)</h2>

We analyzed this data in Excel at the first place and we found that the data can be categorized to several parts. We finally picked three of them, including Devices currently owning, consideration of new device, Terms that could explain to friends, to accomplish our project. Just like project 2, we choose to design and present our project as a website. Each and every member of our group clean the data and plot some graphs. Since some of us use different platforms, we finally decide to combine our code to a single html file and at the same time, linked Gongyuan's original file and embled Hathaway's colormap platformed on Python. 

<h2>Team roles for each individual:</h2>

Tianlun Zhao(BlakeTZ): I'm curious about the each race distribution of every majors in college. So I used python notebook to plot a pie chart by using the data cleaned by Hathaway with race_major. It is about percentage of each race in each major, and it can show us that each race is good at and interested in which major.(Third Page)

Yi Man(yima1736): I clean the "major.csv" data and create a visualization connent with this data. I use d3 to create the viusaliazation, so the debug part is the hardest part for me. There is still a problem that I did not figure out. I want to create a function which can help users to sort the data such as if you click a button, the data will sort from smallest to largest. I am still working on this one. (Third Page)

Gongyuan Xing(DominicXing): I'm very interested in the 5th Asian female student number. I spent a lot of time on cleaning the data and finally, I got the 5th Asian female student number in different enrollment years. I used d3js in html plot a line chart for my data, which illustrated the trend of 5th Asian female student(Fourth Page)

Yonghao Zhang(SilentSingerZ): I plotted a set of bar charts by using the data cleaned by Hathaway with attributes of every country and every all internet connected devices. And I combined everyone's code to a single one as a website, which including Dynamic Queries and excellent UI design. (First Page)

Hathaway Zhang(hathaaaway): Cleaning the raw data "NCWIT_DataV2_RawData.csv". Using the python notebook to clean the major, nan values, and output the dataset to several csv files. Also used the cleaned data to plot a histgram telling the average ACT and SAT scores of each major. (Second Page)
